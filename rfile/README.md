This is a reporsitory for an assignment project for the course *Statistical Methods for Causal Inference* at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Summer School 6-20 July 2024.

Our aim is to study if the Ukraine-Russia war of 2021 has had a different impact on the propensity to vote of right-leaning vs. left-leaning Dutch voters.
