This is a reporsitory for an assignment project for the course *Statistical Methods for Causal Inference* at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Summer School 6-20 July 2024.

Our aim is to study if the [Ukraine-Russia war starting on 24 Feb 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) has had a different impact on the propensity to vote of right-leaning vs. left-leaning Dutch voters.

Our preliminary data preparation: [rfile/LISS-data.md](https://github.com/dianakorka/Data-Science-in-R/blob/main/rfile/LISS-data.md)
